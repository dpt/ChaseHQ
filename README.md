# Chase H.Q. for the ZX Spectrum

Reverse engineering by David Thomas, 2023.

This is the beginnings of a dissasembly of the 48K version of the game. In this repository so far is a [SkoolKit](https://skoolkit.ca/) control file to disassemble the ZX Spectrum 48K version of Chase H.Q. by Ocean Software. This works with the game when it is in a "pristine" as-loaded state.
